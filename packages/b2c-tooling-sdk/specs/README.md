# OAS Schemas

This directory contains OpenAPI Specification (OAS) schemas used for defining and documenting APIs in the B2C tooling ecosystem. These are retrieved from public sources

## OCAPI

Note that the OCAPI DATA schema in ./data-api.json is a modified version adapted from the original Swagger 2.0 to OAS 3.0 and postprocessed to improve compatibility with openapi-fetch tooling. See ../scripts/fix-ocapi-spec.js
